    Features in the mainframe: Add customer, search customer, add flights, book flight, generate ticket.
  
    Menu bar and menu items: Hovering over menu items displays options.

    Internal frame: Different from a normal frame, related to the mainframe.

    Virtual desktop screen.
    
    JInternalFrame is used instead of a regular frame to keep menu item screens within the main window.

    admin, customer, flight, and ticket tables were created.

    GUI was connected with the database.
